This competition asks you to count paperclips on sheets of paper. Image counting applications are common for many sorts of data analysis. Images such as you see on Google Maps are frequent targets. Counting cars, people, trees, houses, water coverage, can all provide valuable information about the demographics of these regions.

For this competition you are given images of paper covered by paperclips. Your task is to count the paperclips and return as accurate of a count as possible. The images are 256x256.

Some images are very easy; Some images are a little more difficult; Some images will be really challenging.

The evaluation for the competition is root mean square error (RMSE). This measures the difference between your predicted number of paperclips and the actual number of paperclips. The actual number of paperclips is always integer; however, you may wish to predict floating-point numbers to account for uncertainty in your model.
